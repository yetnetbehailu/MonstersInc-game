## Design ##
### Wireframe ###
I designed my web application layout using [Figma wireframes](https://www.figma.com). Main criteria was to create an eye-catching bright and vibrant environment, without losing the context visibility maintaining a readable and coherent site. Not to many elements of distractions but rather a simple and clean aesthetic. View my wireframes for each different device below;
