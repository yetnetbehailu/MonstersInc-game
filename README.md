## Design ##
### Wireframe ###
I designed my web application layout using [Figma wireframes](https://www.figma.com). Main criteria was to create an eye-catching bright and vibrant environment, without losing the context visibility maintaining a readable and coherent site. Not to many elements of distractions but rather a simple and clean aesthetic. View my wireframes for each different device below;

  <details>
  The completed site uses many of the concepts from the original Wireframe design however there has been some modifications made along the way, due to visual preference and improved ideas for game UI. 

  - On the initial start page the written text inside the buttons and also the copyright text included in the footer were in the shade of Harlequin(lime green). However due to visibility contrast conflict, I changed the color of the smaller written text to ensure it's readable for people with visual impairments as well.

 - On the current start page there is a button in the top left corner that has been added for sound. In the initial phase i had not thought of adding sound to my web application, this rather occurred to me whilst building my page.

 - The "How to play" button containing the modal for the game instructions holds a more elaborate description including table cells showcasing differences in play levels, on the finished site.

 - The buttons inside the "Start Game" button which re-directs to the different game levels, has got less of a round shape and more of a rectangle shape. Also the buttons receive the bright Harlequin(lime green) shade on hover instead of having it as default. Preferred to have slightly differentiating styles.

- After having re-watched the monsters Inc movie I found some new ideas to make the game a lot more relatable to the movie. Hence, the removed Monsters Inc logo and changed background as well as back card image.
